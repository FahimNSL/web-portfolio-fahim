                My professional journey began at Next Solution Lab as an Associate Full Stack Software Engineer. There, I honed my skills in writing reusable code and comprehensive documentation. I have developed and collaborated on complex systems using React.js for intuitive frontends, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for powerful backends. This includes integrating AI models and deploying applications on AWS EC2. Key projects have involved an office portal for attendance and project management, a multi-vendor e-commerce website, data extraction/annotation tools, and multilingual (English/Japanese) websites.
